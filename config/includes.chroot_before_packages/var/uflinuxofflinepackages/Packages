Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (EFI-AMD64 version)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This is a dependency package for a version of GRUB that has been built for
 use with the EFI-AMD64 architecture, as used by Intel Macs (unless a BIOS
 interface has been activated).  Installing this package indicates that this
 version of GRUB should be the active boot loader.

Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (EFI-AMD64 modules)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a

 installed.
